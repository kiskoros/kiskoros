# Why I use GitHub as a work notebook

For years, I have used tools to produce:
roadmaps, deliverables, solutions.

Much less to think.

AI amplifies this problem.
It allows us to do more things faster,
but also to decide without really understanding.

This notebook is a reaction to that.

## Thinking before scaling

In large organizations, problems rarely come
from a lack of technical capability.

They come from decisions taken too early
and scaled too fast.

Using GitHub as a notebook introduces friction:
- writing forces clarity
- publishing forces ownership
- versioning shows how ideas evolve

I am not looking for quick answers.
I am looking for better questions.

## AI not as a tool, but as a system

AI is not just technology.
It reorganizes decisions, responsibility and power.

Every AI system:
- assumes certain human behaviors
- defines what is “normal” and what is “exception”
- shifts decisions from people to systems

This cannot be solved with metrics alone.

## Crossing into sociology

I am starting Sociology not to add a credential,
but to challenge my professional practice.

Sociology brings questions that engineering often avoids:
- who defines the problem
- who benefits from automation
- what is lost when we optimize

This notebook is where
daily practice and those questions meet.

## Disclaimer

Nothing here is final.
Many ideas will change.
Some will be discarded.

This is not a repository of certainties.
It is a record of conscious learning.
