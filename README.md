This repository is a public work notebook.

It contains reflections, notes and experiments on:
- AI applied to real organizations
- product decision-making in complex systems
- gamification and serious games
- automation understood as an organizational choice
- sociotechnical systems: people, norms and technology

The content is exploratory and evolving.
It documents thinking, not finished answers.
